            Thanks for visiting my site! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ethan Farber, and I am breaking into the freelance web design field. Right now my knowledge consists of HTML, CSS, and Python, but I am learning Javascript and hope to pick up Node and React! Keep Reading to learn even more about me.

        Most people doing freelance web design are using site builders like wordpress, squarespace, or wix. 
        These are good for the freelancer, as they're easy to use, but they offer very little customizability and functionality. This is where I come in. I build all my websites from the ground up. I get my hands dirty with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows me to meet all of my client's needs, creating designs unique to you! I take great pride in my work, and hope that my services will be of interest to you. Below is a form you cna use to reach out if you have any questions!
